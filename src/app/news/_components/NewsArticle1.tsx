      <h2>Immortal Dragons: A Purpose-Driven Longevity Fund</h2>
      <p>
        In today&apos;s rapidly evolving biotechnology landscape, an emerging force is quietly transforming humanity&apos;s
        understanding of lifespan and health. This force is Immortal Dragons (不朽真龙), a purpose-driven fund focused on the
        longevity sector. Unlike traditional investment institutions, Immortal Dragons not only focuses on financial returns but
        is also committed to advancing the entire field of longevity science, contributing to the extension of human healthspan.
      </p>
      <h3>Mission and Vision of Immortal Dragons</h3>
      <p>
        The name itself carries profound meaning: the Chinese name &quot;不朽真龙&quot; symbolizes eternity and power, while the
        English name directly echoes the company&apos;s core mission of pursuing longevity. The establishment of this fund stems
        from the founders&apos; contemplation and challenge of the limits of human healthspan. In Immortal Dragons&apos;
        philosophy, death is not an inevitable fate but a technical problem that can be delayed or even ultimately overcome
        through scientific means. This forward-thinking approach enables Immortal Dragons to dare to attempt more radical and
        cutting-edge projects in their investment strategy, particularly in areas that traditional investment institutions might
        shy away from due to excessive risk.

      <h3>Unique Investment Philosophy </h3>
      <p>Immortal Dragons&apos; investment philosophy has three distinct characteristics:</p>
      <h4>1. Radical Frontier </h4>
      <p>
        Immortal Dragons tends to invest in higher-risk projects with disruptive potential, particularly technologies related to
        &quot;replacing parts,&quot; such as whole-body replacement, blood replacement, head replacement, organ replacement,
        cloning, and 3D-printed organs. While these technologies may seem overly radical at present, they could become key
        breakthroughs for extending human lifespan in the future.
      </p>
      <h4>2. Infrastructure</h4>
      <p>
        Immortal Dragons values infrastructure projects that can accelerate clinical trials and research, such as special
        economic zones. While these investments don&apos;t directly produce scientific results, they can provide more efficient
        R&D environments for the entire industry, indirectly accelerating progress in longevity science.
      </p>
      <h4>3. Technology-Driven</h4>
      <p>
        Immortal Dragons focuses on technologies that can accelerate medical progress, such as artificial intelligence and
        digital twins. These technologies can significantly improve research efficiency, reduce costs, and accelerate the
        translation process from laboratory to clinic.
